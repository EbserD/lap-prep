# Thoughts in advance

First of all i thought about doing the LAP in my own style ... like creating a fullstack application with a [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org) database using [docker](https://www.docker.com) and also building docker images for the application to be able to deploy the application to any cloud-platform.

But since i noticed that i can not install docker because off insufficient privileges of the user ... i decided to do the "recommended" approach, using mysql and php ... even though from my point of view this technology is way out of date.
